Write a blog about objects and its internal representation in Javascript

    -> An object is a collection of properties, and a property is an association between name and value.
    -> In JavaScript, an object is a standalone entity, with properties and type. Compare it with a cup, for example.
 A cup is an object, with properties. A cup has a color, a design, weight, a material it is made of, etc. The same way, 
 JavaScript objects can have properties, which define their characteristics.
